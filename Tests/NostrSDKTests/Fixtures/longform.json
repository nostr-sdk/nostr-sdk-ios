Controversies like the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal – where personal data was used for political advertising – and censorship tactics used on popular sites like Twitter have forced users to look for better alternatives.\\n\\nTo bridge this gap, several decentralized social media platforms have emerged. These aim to empower users by granting them control over their data, removing advertisements, and banning social media addiction-inducing algorithms. Out of the lot, a protocol called Nostr has stood out, amassing thousands of users.\\n\\nIs Nostr the answer to social network concerns? What about other alternative decentralized social media platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon?\\n\\nIn this article, we try to answer these questions.\\n\\nWhat is Nostr? \\nNostr (Notes and Other Stuff, Transmitted by Relays) is an open protocol on top of which developers can create censorship-resistant social media applications. The Nostr Manifesto was first published in November 2019 by its pseudonymous creator Fiatjaf.\\n\\nRemember that Nostr is not a social media platform like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. It provides the infrastructure needed to create a decentralized social media network.\\n\\nIris, Damus, Nos, Amethyst, and Gossip are among the many social media applications built on Nostr. These are also called clients. \\n\\nHow does Nostr work?\\nRelays are the critical components in the Nostr protocol. They are backend servers that allow various social media platforms to send messages to one another. Relays can store user posts and messages, enabling seamless interaction across platforms.\\n\\nUsers can connect to multiple relays to save their account details, posts, and social interactions. Connecting to several relays ensures that a user always has access to their data in case a relay goes offline or gets censored. Nostr also allows users to run their own private relay to remove doubts about becoming censorable. At the time of writing, 218 Nostr relays were online.\\n\\nEach user account on Nostr has a public-private key pair. You can think about public keys as usernames with which you can search for your friend’s Nostr profile. Your private key is your password. \\n\\nUsers can jump between various decentralized social applications built on Nostr using their public-private keys. If you get kicked out of platform ABC, then you can move all your posts, messages, and followers to another platform XYZ and carry out business as usual.\\n\\nAlthough there are a lot of similarities between the Nostr protocol and blockchain protocols, Nostr is not a blockchain. It is simply a set of rules. Nostr, however, does draw inspiration from blockchain protocols like Bitcoin in championing decentralization and interoperability.\\n\\nJust like the Bitcoin network, Nostr is not owned by any corporation. Changes to the protocol are pitched, discussed, and approved by the community in the form of Nostr Implementation Possibilities (NIPs) on GitHub.\\n\\nAccording to Greg Heartsfield, “Nostr tries to solve the problem of publishing short notes (“and other stuff”) on the Internet.”\\n\\n“Twitter solved this problem neatly, then complicated it through API and client restrictions, advertising, and a clumsy interface. Finally, they fully unsolved it by inserting themselves as the arbiters of what speech is allowed.”\\n\\nWhy is decentralized social media needed?\\nThe loss of trust in centralized platforms like Twitter and the increasing degree of censorship practised on social media platforms has prompted developers like Fiatjaf to create decentralized social media protocols. In the Nostr Manifesto, Fiatjaf noted several problems with Twitter, namely ads, algorithms, banning and shadow-banning users, and spamming.\\n\\nNostr has seen an influx of new users since 2022. This came during a turbulent time for Twitter which saw Elon Musk buy the microblogging platform for $44 billion. During Musk’s Twitter reign, the company has made a slew of changes that sparked the ire of some users. It implemented anti-free speech moves like censoring links to external websites, discontinuing free access to the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API), and suspending the Twitter accounts of prominent journalists.\\n\\nAs the masses flocked to decentralized social platforms on Nostr, the total number of users on the protocol – measured by “profiles with bio and contact list” – skyrocketed from about 800 on 7 December 2022 to over 315,000 by the first week of June 2023.\\n\\nEndorsements from Twitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey have also helped increase Nostr’s reach and visibility. Dorsey not only tweets about Nostr on a frequent basis, but he has also donated 14 BTC – worth over $381,000 at the time of writing – to Nostr creator Fiatjaf.\\nOther famous names like Edward Snowden have also voiced their support for Nostr. The crypto community, in particular, has shown an affinity for Nostr, given similar principles of decentralization that the two communities uphold. \\n\\nFurthermore, recent improvements on Nostr, allowing users to send BTC to each other via the Lightning Network, have attracted Bitcoiners to the protocol.",
