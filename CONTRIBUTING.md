## Core Principles

- Always scope declarations as tightly as possible. That means everything that CAN be marked private, should be marked private.
- No global functions. Everything should be encapsulated somehow. Swift's protocol extensions are a very lightweight and composable way to do this, though sometimes you will need a class.
- All deterministic functions should have good unit test coverage.
- Prefer newer patterns in Swift, such as async-await and Combine.
- Match terminology in the official [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) repo and [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) as closely as possible.
- Make public interfaces as clean, simple, and readable as possible. Bury complexity that the call site doesnâ€™t need. Apple does this very effectively with their APIs.
- Automate as much as possible (test execution, release process, building API documentation site).
